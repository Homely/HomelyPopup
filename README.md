This is a set of templates to be used by hiring candidates for the HomelyPopup excercise.

You can choose from one of the following project templates:
- ASP.NET Core 2 API
- ASP.NET MVC / Web API

There is no code in any of the templates other than what File > New in Visual Studio brings.

However, seperate projects have been added to each sln, to give the candidate a 'hint' to the type of work required.

Good luck! :)
